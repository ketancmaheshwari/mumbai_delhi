Delhi is a vibrant place with lot to offer (pollution is one of them), you can plan your based on either exploring the neighborhood and places around where you're going to stay or visit most famous places which are major tourist attractions. It's been 3 years since the last time I was in Delhi but I'll try to give you some ideas based on my experience.

I'll start with major attractions:
    India gate
    Akshardham
    Lodhi garden
    Cannaught place
    Dilli haat
    Gurudwara bangla saheb
    Nizamuddin dargah
    Qutub minar

If you're a foodie and want to get a taste of Delhi then these places are famous for their food:

    Tilak Nagar - Punjabi food
    Netaji subhash place - lots of fusion food
    Karol bagh - lots of chaat options
    Dwarka sector 7 - MOMOS - I have a personal restaurant recommendation called KC restaurant
    Karol bagh has some delicious food with variety of options.

West Delhi:
    Rock garden
    Tilak nagar market
    Dilli haat
    Jheel park

South Delhi:
    Qutub minar
    Hauz Khas village
    Garden of five senses
    Lotus temple

North Delhi:
    Majnu ka Tilla (Delhi's little tibet)
    Red fort
    India gate
    National Zoological park of Delhi

East Delhi:
    Akshardham
    Sanjay lake
    Chota bazar
    Raj ghat

Finally, if you feel like you wanna blend in and not seem like an outsider then just throw a couple of bencho in your conversations XD

1.Deer Park, Hauz Khas. ( Social has some good food, kinda expensive) 2. Khan Market ( again for food) 3. Hudson Lane ( North Campus) (food) 4. If you guys are into museums, you can visit the new Prime Minister's meuseum in New Delhi. It's pretty cool. 5. If you wanna watch a movie and hangout in a mall, Select city walk in Saket is a good option.

PS: I've lived here since birth and I also am unaware of places here. It's always the PG guys from outside who know all about our city!

2. Then, after some hour in Sunder Nursery, walk to the Nizamuddin dargah which is like 5 minutes walk.

3. And then like in the evening, visit Zakir Nagar. Take a walk in tje street, and try out Qureshi Kabab, Gulawati Kabab, Zahra Restuarant's Biryani, try some local sweets too.
